Description

An easy-to-use Pokedex app that loads Pokemons and their images as the user scrolls. When a Pokemon is selected, the app will highlight it and center it at the top of the app while displaying its name. Features include pagination, custom Pokemon card backgrounds, and Pokemon select.

Design

I used the Swift storyboard structure to create this app for iPhone 11. I decided that manually designing the UI would be easier than coding it programmataically. As a result, my main backend logic and data was stored in a ViewController. I decided to use Swift's built-in CollectionView because it allowed me to create cells that displayed the Pokemon. After fetching the Pokemon data and decoding it, I utilized CollectionView instance methods to handle user input and cell rendering. I also wanted to indicate when a Pokemon was selected so I decided to use custom backgrounds for the cells, which I acheived through some Photoshop.

I really had a great time working on this take home project and I was drawn more and more in as I proceeded to work. This was my first ever Swift project and it honestly felt like it was a personal project because I also love Pokemon and iOS development has always been an interest of mine. I spent many hours, more than what was probably expected, because I wanted to make sure that the final product was something I was satisfied with. I wasn't able to get to milestone 3, image caching, but if I could continue to work on this project, my future goals would be image caching, adding more information, and trying to emulate the real Pokedex.
